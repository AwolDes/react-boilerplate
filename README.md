# react-redux-boilerplate
A lightweight and simple React and Redux boilerplate.

# Getting Started
`sudo npm i/install`
`sudo npm run dev/build`

# Features

* Build processes for dev & prod
* Hot reloading
* SASS compiling

# Pipeline

* Bundles [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with `jsx` syntax
* Compiles ES6 (with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/))
* Linting (with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/))
* Build with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* Develop locally with [webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)

### Cheers To

[Cian O'Leary](https://github.com/25564) for teaching me React and helping set up the pipeline.
